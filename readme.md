time taken to build this page : 1.5 hours [along with media queries, active states styling]

### The challenge

- styling the landing page
- responsive landing page depending on various device's screen size
- implement hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- writing css code section wise
- once whole page is built focus on active states like hover, focus etc..
- after active states , focus on media queries

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS flexbox
- made responsive with media queries

### What I learned

- positioning
- flexbox
- for statically positioned items we cant provide z-index
- media queries
- using css variables
- ```js
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />

  /*In this case, preconnect is used to indicate that the browser should establish an early connection to the resource, but not actually fetch any data from it immediately. This helps in reducing latency when the resource is later requested, as some preliminary work (like DNS resolution, TCP handshake, and TLS negotiation) is already done.*/
  ```
